## Introduction

Sparse matrices are matrices that contain mostly zero values. This repository provides a Python implementation to handle sparse matrices efficiently. It includes methods for matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication using sparse matrix representation.

## Features

- **Sparse Matrix Representation:** Efficient storage and manipulation of matrices with large dimensions and mostly zero values.
- **Operations:** Support for basic matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- **File Input:** Read matrix data from text files in a specific format to initialize sparse matrices.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/julianacholder/dsa_sparse_matrix.git
   cd dsa
